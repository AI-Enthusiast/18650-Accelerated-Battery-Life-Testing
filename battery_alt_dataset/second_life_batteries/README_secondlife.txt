Second life batteries (second life batteries folder):

This folder contains the data files from battery packs that consist of battery cells survived from previously cycled battery packs. 
The assigned battery packs in this folder are numbered as follows:

â€“ 2nd life battery packs:
The following batteries were subjected to constant current levels at the first provided amplitudes until reaching end of life (EOL).
Survivor cells were then reused and subjected to the second provided current level until reaching EOL

The here provided averaged current levels are approximated, and might vary slightly:

* 16.0A, 9.3A: Battery pack 1.3 (First life battery packs: 0.0 & 1.1)
* 14.3A, 7.5A: Battery pack 3.6 (First life battery packs: 2.3 & 5.2)
* 12.9A, 5.0A: Battery pack 5.4 (First life battery packs: 2.2 & 3.1)

Recommissioned batteries (recommissioned batteries folder):

This folder contains the data files from battery packs where the constant loading conditions were changed throughout the battery life. 
The assigned battery packs in this folder are numbered as follows:

– Two life stages:
The following batteries were subjected to constant current levels at the first provided amplitudes until reaching an capacity level of approximately 2.2Ah,
and then switched to the second current level until reaching end of life

The here provided averaged current levels are approximated, and might vary slightly:

* 16A, 14.3A: Battery pack 3.2
* 14.3A, 16A: Battery pack 5.3
* 16A, 12.9A: Battery pack 0.2 and 3.3
* 16A, 9.30A: Battery pack 1.2 and 2.4

– Three life stages:
Those batteries were subjected to current level switches at approximately 2.2Ah and 2.0Ah of capacity.
The here provided averaged current levels are approximated, and might vary slightly:

* 16A, 14.3A, 7.5A: Battery pack 0.3
* 16A, 7.5A, 14.3A: Battery pack 2.5

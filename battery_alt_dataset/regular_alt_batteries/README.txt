Regular accelerated life test (regular alt batteries folder):

This folder contains the data files from battery packs subject to constant and variable loading conditions, 
where the current range of the latter remains the same throughout the battery life.

The assigned battery packs in this folder are numbered as
follows:

– Constant current:
Those battery packs were subjected to the same load level during discharge missions over their respective life time.

The here provided averaged current levels are approximated, and might vary slightly:

* 9.30A: Battery pack 0.1 and 1.1
* 12.9A: Battery pack 3.1 and 2.2
* 14.3A: Battery pack 2.3 and 5.2
* 16.0A: Battery pack 0.0 and 1.0
* 19.0A: Battery pack 2.0, 3.0 and 2.1

– Variable current:

Those battery packs are subjected to variable current within a discharge cycle.
The current level segments are kept constant for either 40, 60 or 80 seconds before switching to another level.
Both, the amplitude and length of each current level segments was randomly selected to create a pool of different random loading discharge missions.

The here provided averaged current levels are approximated, and might vary slightly:

* 14.3A average (12.9A - 16A range): Battery pack 4.1 and 5.1
* 17.0A average (16A - 19A range): Battery pack 4.0 and 5.0

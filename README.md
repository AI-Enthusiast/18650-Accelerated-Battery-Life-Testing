# 18650 Battery Accelerated Life Testing Survival Analysis vs Machine Learning

#### Aryan Bhardwaj, Cormac Dacker, Avery Pike, Tyler Gomez Riddick

## Introduction
- 18650 batteries are a common type of lithium-ion battery used in a variety of applications, including electric vehicles, laptops, and power tools.
- The batteries are known to degrade over time, with the rate of degradation depending on a variety of factors, including temperature, depth of discharge, and charge/discharge cycles.
- The goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of survival analysis and machine learning in predicting the remaining useful life of 18650 batteries based on accelerated life testing data.
